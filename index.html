                <h2>THE FORCE AWAKENS</h2>
                 <p>    It is a dark time for the
                    Rebellion. Although the Death
                    Star has been destroyed,
                    Imperial troops have driven the
                    Rebel forces from their hidden
                    base and pursued them across
                    the galaxy.
                 </p>
                    
                 <p>   Evading the dreaded Imperial
                    Starfleet, a group of freedom
                    fighters led by Luke Skywalker
                    has established a new secret
                    base on the remote ice world
                    of Hoth.
                 </p>   
                    
                 <p>The evil lord Darth Vader,
                    obsessed with finding young
                    Skywalker, has dispatched
                    thousands of remote probes into
                    the far reaches of space....
                 </p>
                <p>   
                    Luke Skywalker has returned to
                    his home planet of Tatooine in
                    an attempt to rescue his
                    friend Han Solo from the
                    clutches of the vile gangster
                    Jabba the Hutt.
                </p>   
                <p>
                Little does Luke know that the
                    GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
                    begun construction on a new
                    armored space station even
                    more powerful than the first
                    dreaded Death Star.
                </p>   
                    
                <p>
                    When completed, this ultimate
                    weapon will spell certain doom
                    for the small band of rebels
                    struggling to restore freedom
                    to the galaxy...
                    Turmoil has engulfed the
                    Galactic Republic. The taxation
                    of trade routes to outlying star
                    systems is in dispute.
                </p>

                <p>
                        Hoping to resolve the matter
                    with a blockade of deadly
                    battleships, the greedy Trade
                    Federation has stopped all
                    shipping to the small planet
                    of Naboo.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    While the Congress of the
                    Republic endlessly debates
                    this alarming chain of events,
                    the Supreme Chancellor has
                    secretly dispatched two Jedi
                    Knights, the guardians of
                    peace and justice in the
                    galaxy, to settle the conflict....
                    It is a period of civil war.
                    Rebel spaceships, striking
                    from a hidden base, have won
                    their first victory against
                    the evil Galactic Empire.
                </p>
                    
                <p>During the battle, Rebel
                    spies managed to steal secret
                    plans to the Empire's
                    ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                    STAR, an armored space
                    station with enough power to
                    destroy an entire planet.
                </p>
                 <p>   Pursued by the Empire's
                    sinister agents, Princess
                    Leia races home aboard her
                    starship, custodian of the
                    stolen plans that can save
                    her people and restore
                    freedom to the galaxy.....
                </p>
